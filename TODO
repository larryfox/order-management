DECISIONS & THOUGHTS

Using SQLite as a database, it has no external dependencies to set up and will
be sufficient for this project

Would probably use some sort of UUID as the primary key in production but SQLite
automatically generates integer primary keys

An OrderStatus table might make sense, so a chronological list of all statuses
could be returned, as is only the latest status is known

LineItem might make sense as it's own module instead of shoe horned into Order


ENTITIES

Order
id
createdAt
updatedAt
canceledAt
status
trackingId
shippingProvider

LineItem
id
orderId
sku
quantity
cost
